# housle_optimizer

Just trying to see if I can find an optimal housle guess. 

It's kind of half-assed, and also trying to practice writing code where I don't DRY too early, but instead copy-paste a bunch until I see very clear patterns.

Right now, I'm sure there's more I could change, but I am late for something and I doubt I'll ever revisit this code. 
So it goes.
